<h3>Course description</h3>
<p>In this course, students will learn how to program in R and how to use R for effective data analysis and visualization. Turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge (Wickham &amp; Grolemund, 2017, p. ix) using R to import, prepare, understand, and communicate your data findings. The course begins with developing a basic understanding of the R working environment. Next, students will be introduced the necessary arithmetic and logical operators, salient functions for manipulating data, and getting help using R. Next, the common data structures, variables, and data types used in R will be demonstrated and applied. Students will write R scripts and build R markdown documents to share their code others. They will utilize the various packages available in R for visualization, reporting, data manipulation, and statistical analysis. Students import data sets, transform and manipulate those datasets for various analytical purposes. Students will learn how to create control structures, such as loops and conditional statements to traverse, sort, merge, and evaluate data. Finally, students create interactive business applications that allow for data querying and data exploration. This course is designed for those who have no experience in R or programming.</p>
<h3>Learning outcomes</h3>
<p>By the end of the course you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the fundamental syntax of R through readings, practice exercises, demonstrations, and writing R code.</li>
<li>Apply critical programming language concepts such as data types, iteration, control structures, functions, and boolean operators by writing R programs and through examples</li>
<li>Import a variety of data formats into R using RStudio</li>
<li>Prepare or tidy data for in preparation for analysis</li>
<li>Analyze a data set in R and present findings using the appropriate R packages<br />Visualize data attributes using ggplot2 and other R packages.</li>
</ul>
